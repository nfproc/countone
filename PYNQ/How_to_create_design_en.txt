1. Create a folder.
   We assume that the folder is created as c:\research\TRNG_design

2. Copy the contents of the zip file into the created folder,
   or alternatively, clone the repository using Git.

3. Launch Vivado and create a new project.
   Set PYNQ-Z1 as the target device.

4. Click [PROJECT MANAGER -> Settings]
   Click the + button in the IP Repositories list in the [IP -> Repository] page.
   Select and add the ip_repo folder (C:\research\TRNG_design\PYNQ\ip_repo).

5. Create a new block design.

6. Add a ZYNQ7 Processing System and perform [Run Block Automation].

7. Double-click the created ZYNQ7 Processing System to open the properties window.
   Proceed to the [PS-PL Configuration] page and
   check the [HP Slave AXI Interface -> S AXI HP0 interface] option.
   You can safely ignore warnings that appear at this time.

8. Add the following five IP cores:
  - TC_TERO_IP_v1_0
  - Countone
  - AXI Direct Memory Access
  - AXI4-Stream Broadcaster
  - AXI4-Stream Data Width Converter

9. Double-click the AXI Direct Memory Access block.
   Uncheck [Enable Scatter Gather Engine] and [Enable Read Channel].

10. Double-click the AXI4-Stream Data Width Converter block.
    Set the value of [Master Interface TDATA WIDTH] to 1 (byte).

11. Perform [Run Connection Automation].
    This will create bus connections from the processor to the IP cores.

12. Connect the following signals manually:
  - TC_TERO_IP_v1_0 - AXIS_RNG                -> AXI4-Stream Broadcaster - S_AXIS
  - AXI4-Stream Broadcaster - M00_AXIS        -> AXI Direct Memory Access - S_AXIS_S2MM
  - AXI4-Stream Broadcaster - M01_AXIS        -> AXI4-Stream Data Width Converter - S_AXIS
  - AXI4-Stream Data Width Converter - M_AXIS -> Countone - rand_in

13. Perform [Run Connection Automation] again.
    This will connect clock and reset signals to the stream IP cores.

See block_design.pdf for the resultant block diagram.
You can automate the processes 5 through 13 by running block_design.tcl
