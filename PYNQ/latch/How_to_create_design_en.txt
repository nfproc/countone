1. Create a folder.
   We assume that the folder is created as c:\research\TRNG_design

2. Copy the contents of the zip file into the created folder,
   or alternatively, clone the repository using Git.

3. Launch Vivado and create a new project.
   Set PYNQ-Z1 as the target device.

4. Click [PROJECT MANAGER -> Settings]
   Click the + button in the IP Repositories list in the [IP -> Repository] page.
   Select and add the ip_repo folder (C:\research\TRNG_design\PYNQ\ip_repo).

5. Create a new block design.

6. Add a ZYNQ7 Processing System and perform [Run Block Automation].

7. Double-click the created ZYNQ7 Processing System to open the properties window.
   Proceed to the [PS-PL Configuration] page and
   check the [HP Slave AXI Interface -> S AXI HP0 interface] option.
   You can safely ignore warnings that appear at this time.

8. Add the following two IP cores:
  - TRNG_IP_LATCH
  - AXI Direct Memory Access

9. Double-click the AXI Direct Memory Access block.
   Uncheck [Enable Scatter Gather Engine] and [Enable Read Channel].

10. Perform [Run Connection Automation].
    This will create bus connections from the processor to the IP cores.

11. Connect the following signals manually:
  - TRNG_IP_LATCH - AXIS_RNG -> AXI Direct Memory Access - S_AXIS_S2MM

See block_design.pdf for the resultant block diagram.
You can automate the processes 5 through 11 by running block_design.tcl
(Tools -> Run Tcl Script)
