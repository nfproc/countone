Hardware-oriented implementation of the "count the ones" test
=============================================================

Abstract
--------

This repository contains an HLS implementation of on-the-fly randomness
test circuit for TRNGs, presented in the following paper.

> Ryusei Oya, Naoki Fujieda, and Shuichi Ichikawa: An HLS implementation
> of on-the-fly randomness test for TRNGs, 10th International Symposium
> on Computing and Networking (CANDAR 2022), pp. 151â€“157 (11/2022).

It also includes a demonstration system for PYNQ-Z1. 
The system is developed for PYNQ 2.7 and synthesized with Xilinx Vivado
2020.2 and Vitis HLS 2020.2.

Organization of Repository
--------------------------

The hierarchy of the repository is as follows:

- `C_src`: C source code of the test circuit
- `PYNQ`: Set of source code of the demonstration system
  - `ip_repo`: IP cores for the system
  - `jupyter`: Jupyter Notebook to validate the system
- `rand_data`: random bitstrings used in C testbench

------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to Use
----------

### Getting Started

Files in the `PYNQ/jupyter` folder are used to confirm the working system.

Upload all of the files to somewhere under the jupyter_notebookes folder of
a PYNQ board and open the notebook (TRNG_TEST.ipynb)

### High Level Synthesis

Files in the `C_src` folder are used for high level synthsis.

Create a Vitis HLS project. Add countone.cpp, define.hpp, and prob_table.hpp
to the project as design files. Add main.cpp as a testbench file.
The target function of the high level synthesis is countone.

The bit widths of the fraction part of chsq and ev variables, which are
treated as parameters in the paper, are defined in define.cpp as CHSQ_F and
EV_F, respectively. By performing C simulation, the average error ratio
(comparing with the floating-point implementation) can be measured.

### Synthesis of Demonstration System

The system is generated from a block diagram.
Refer to `PYNQ/How_to_create_design_en.txt` for details.
